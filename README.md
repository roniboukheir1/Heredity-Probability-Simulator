# Heredity-Probability-Simulator

This Python program simulates the heredity patterns of a trait passed down through a family over generations. It calculates the probabilities of family members having a specific gene and the associated trait based on their parents' genetic information.

Description

The simulator models the inheritance of a gene that can cause a particular trait. It takes into account the unconditional probabilities for having zero, one, or two copies of the gene and the probabilities of expressing a trait given the number of gene copies. The program also accounts for gene mutation, which can alter the inheritance pattern.

Features

- Load gene and trait data from a CSV file.
- Calculate joint probability distributions for gene and trait presence in a family.
- Update and normalize probabilities for each family member.
- Utilize a Monte Carlo simulation to estimate probabilities.

Usage

To run the heredity simulation, you need to provide a CSV file containing the family data. The CSV should have columns for `name`, `mother`, `father`, and `trait`. The `trait` column should contain `0` or `1` if the trait presence is known, or be blank if unknown.

bash

python heredity.py data.csv
